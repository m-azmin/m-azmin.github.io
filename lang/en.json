    "title": "About Me",
    "description1": "I’m Azmin Yusmizan, an electrical engineering student with a deep passion for innovation, embedded systems, and sustainable technologies. Over the years, I’ve cultivated a strong technical foundation in electronics, PCB design, signal processing, and automation — shaped by a unique international journey across Malaysia and France.",
    "description2": "Studying at institutions like INSA Lyon, IUT Paul Sabatier Toulouse, and Université de Tours has exposed me to diverse technical cultures and collaborative projects, pushing me to be both detail-oriented and adaptable. Whether it’s building smart energy systems, programming embedded devices, or simulating high-frequency antennas, I enjoy turning complex ideas into practical, elegant solutions.",
    "description3": "Beyond academics, I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and a love for continuous learning. I find joy in reading, cooking, sketching, and playing the guitar — all of which balance the intensity of engineering with moments of calm and expression.",
